# Horiseon-Refactor
Bootcamp Homework 1

This webpage was refactored from its original state to follow more stringent accessibility guidelines and the HTML was gently reformatted for the sake of cleanliness.

Alt text was added to all linked images on the page.
General tags were replaced with semantic HTML tags to reflect the goal of greater accessibility.

The structure of the page remains the same as when it was submitted for refactoring.
